			<h2>WP-Optimize is now part of the UpdraftPlus family!</h2>

			<p>We're pleased to announce with this new version (2.0) that WP-Optimize is now developed, supported and owned by <a href="https://updraftplus.com">UpdraftPlus</a>, the world's most installed WordPress backup/restore plugin.</p>

			<p>This release has no major changes or features on the outside (apart from a few bug fixes). What it is, is a complete re-factorization of the plugin on the inside. The code structure is now totally different to make future development quicker, and to enable a future remote-control facility for users with multiple sites (through <a href="https://updraftcentral.com">UpdraftCentral)</a>.</p>
			
			<p>We are quite excited to have reached this stage which lays a solid foundation for lots of future improvements. Watch this space and sign up to the <a href="https://updraftplus.com/newsletter-signup">UpdraftPlus newsletter</a> for updates!</p>

			<h2>Why do you need a backup plugin?</h2>
			<p>Websites crash, get hacked; hosting companies make mistakes or go bust; plugin and theme authors release code with unwanted errors in; site editors make mistakes too. With a backup, you can be back up and running again in minutes. Without - everything is gone.</p>
			
			<p>Do backups have anything to do with optimising? Yes. When WP-Optimize cleans up part of the database such as unpublished comments, or old post drafts, then the contents get permanently deleted. If there's even a remote chance you'll regret this later, then you ought to take a backup!</p>
			
			<h2>Why choose UpdraftPlus to backup my site?</h2>
			
			<p>Not all backup plugins are created equal. The following are essential features:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>The ability to set an <strong>automatic backup schedule</strong>: it's too easy to forget to take the backup you really needed. Much better to set it up and leave it to do the work for you.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The ability to <strong>backup to remote storage</strong> like Dropbox or Google Drive: if your backups are only in your webspace, then you can lose both at once (to hackers, server failure, etc.).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The ability to <strong>restore your website</strong> for you from your backups. Unfortunately, most WordPress backup plugins force you to learn about how to restore by hand!</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">UpdraftPlus</a> is the most trusted and installed backup plugin because it does all of this and more reliably, for free. There is also a premium version which can do <a href="https://updraftplus.com">a lot more</a>.</p>
